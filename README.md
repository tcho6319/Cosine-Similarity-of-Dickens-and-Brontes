# Cosine-Similarity-of-Dickens-and-Brontes
This Jupyter Notebook file was created with Ian Wilke-Tomasik as part of a Intro Data Science Project. 

The objective was to compute the cosine similarities among the novels written by the Bronte sisters and Charles Dickens. Words were extracted from .csv files in order to vectorize word counts of the Bronte sisters' novels and two Charles Dickens novels. The word-count vectors for each novel were used to compute cosine similarities.
